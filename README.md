# AutoML_Regressor
  ## Simple AutoML library for regression to evaluate different regressors
    1. Deal with missing values in data-set
    2. Scaling for numerical values
    3. Encoding for categorical values
    4. Feature selection through F-test (ANOVA)
  ## The library can give a tuned model by evaluating following regressors:
    1. Linear Regression
    2. Random Forest Regression
    3. XG Boost Regression
    4. Elastic Net Regression
  ## Cross-validation is used to prevent over-fitting on training set
  ## Scoring function to select model is Root Mean Square Error
